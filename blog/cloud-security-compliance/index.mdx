# Cloud Security Compliance with Resoto

**A security baseline is a set of rules that all cloud resources must adhere to.** (The concept and rationale of security compliance and how to build a baseline were introduced in [Cloud Resource Security Benchmarks](../cloud-resource-security-benchmarks/index.mdx).)

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, cybersecurity has become a non-negotiable aspect of doing business. More than ever, organizations are recognizing the importance of security compliance in cloud infrastructure.

In this blog post, we'll delve into the intricacies of enforcing a security baseline. We will explore the challenges that organizations face and how they can overcome them. We will also look at how Resoto can help you achieve security compliance in your cloud infrastructure.

## Challenges to Security Compliance

Ensuring security compliance for cloud infrastructure no trivial task, due to the shared responsibility of different personas able to create, update, and delete cloud resources. Unfortunately, there is no single gatekeeper that can track and enforce security compliance for all cloud resources.

Let's review the most urgent challenges:

1. **Lack of Security Knowledge**

   Developers and SREs may not have comprehensive knowledge of security best practices and the specific requirements for securing cloud infrastructure.

   This can lead to the unintentional introduction of security vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

2. **Time Constraints**

   Developers and SREs are often focused on meeting project deadlines and delivering functionality, which can result in security considerations being overlooked or deprioritized.

   The pressure to deliver quickly may lead to shortcuts or the bypassing of security controls.

3. **DevOps Culture**

   The DevOps culture emphasizes rapid development and deployment, blurring the traditional boundaries between development and operations.

   While this culture promotes agility, collaboration, and efficiency, it can sometimes overlook security measures or create conflicts between security and development priorities.

4. **Lack of Communication and Collaboration**

   In some cases, there may be a communication gap between security teams and developers/SREs.

   Security requirements and guidelines are not always clearly communicated, resulting in misunderstandings and/or inconsistent implementation of security controls.

## Solutions to Security Compliance Challenges

While these challenges pose significant hurdles, there are actionable steps that organizations can take to mitigate their impacts. The common thread that binds these issues is the human factor. To effectively address these challenges, organizations must take a comprehensive, multi-pronged approach.

1. **Integration of Security into Development Workflows**

   Introducing automated security testing, vulnerability scanning, and code analysis into the continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines can help identify and mitigate security issues early in the development process.

2. **Security Training and Awareness Programs**

   Developers and SREs should be provided with training to enhance their understanding of security best practices and the importance of security compliance in cloud infrastructure.

   By empowering developers and SREs with knowledge, they are less likely to unintentionally introduce vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

3. **Automating Security Compliance Processes**

   Configuration management, infrastructure as code (IaC), and security policy enforcement tools can automate repetitive or complex tasks, reducing the potential for human error and also freeing up developer hours to focus on what they do best – delivering functionality.

In essence, enforcing security compliance is not a task for a single team or tool but requires a concerted effort across the organization.

## Security Compliance Checks in Resoto

As discussed in [Cloud Resource Security Benchmarks](../cloud-resource-security-benchmarks/index.mdx), Resoto allows you to define and check resources with a security baseline.

Resoto UI allows you to easily review security benchmark results to see affected cloud resources and remediate issues.

### Generating a Security Benchmark Report with the Resoto CLI

The issue starts with the next cloud resource that is created, updated, or deleted. How can you ensure that **any new or updated cloud resource is compliant with your security baseline?**

Resoto has not only a gorgeous UI but also a powerful CLI that allows you to perform the same security checks as in the UI.

Let's see what this looks like. Assume we want to check all our AWS accounts for compliance with the [CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/amazon_web_services/). We can issue the following command:

```bash
> report benchmark run aws_cis_1_5
```

This will look for all AWS accounts that have been collected and render a nice report for every account in the terminal that looks like this.

![Report Run Result](./img/report-run-result.png)

The `report` command can be customized by command line options - see `help report` for more details.

If you want to get the report in raw Markdown format, you can simply pipe the output of the `report` command to the `write` command:

```bash
> report benchmark run aws_cis_1_5 | write report.md
```

This would write the report to the file `report.md` to the [Resoto Shell download directory](/docs/reference/components/shell#options)⁠—useful in cases where you want to share or perform additional processing on the results.

### Security Report Result Notifitcations

Not only can we write the result of a report to a file, but we could also take the result and send a message to [Slack](/docs/how-to-guides/alerting/send-slack-notifications) or [Discord](/docs/how-to-guides/alerting/send-discord-notifications).

To make the message as precise and meaningful as possible, we define the account explicitly and only send the message if there are any issues:

```bash
> report benchmark run aws_cis_1_5 --accounts 7524xxxx --only-failing --only-check-results | discord --title "Security Benchmark Issues!\nAccount 7524xxxx does not adhere to AWS CIS 1.5" --key .name --value .number_of_resources_failing --webhook https://discord.com/api/webhooks/123/234
```

If the [`report` command](/docs/reference/cli/miscellaneous-commands/report) does not find any issues in the defined account, no message will be sent. If there are issues, the message will look similar to this one:

![Discord Message](./img/discord-message.jpg)

### Create an alert in PagerDuty or AlertManager

Resoto does not only interface with well-known chat applications like Slack or Discord but also with [PagerDuty](/docs/how-to-guides/alerting/create-pagerduty-alerts) or [AlertManager](/docs/how-to-guides/alerting/send-prometheus-alertmanager-alerts). Let's assume you have a PagerDuty account and set up an integration.

You can create a PagerDuty alert like so:

```bash
> report benchmark run aws_cis_1_5 --accounts 75246xxxx --only-failing --only-check-results | pagerduty --summary "Security Benchmark Issues! Account 7524xxxx does not adhere to AWS CIS 1.5" --routing-key <your-pagerduty-routing-key> --dedup-key AWS_CIS_75246xxxx --resource-id .reported.name --group-resources false --resource-properties {failing_resources: .reported.number_of_resources_failing}
```

:::note

`routing-key` is your PagerDuty integration key. `dedup-key` is used to group alerts together.

:::

Once the report command finds issues in the defined account, a PagerDuty alert will be created that looks like this:

![PagerDuty Alert](./img/pagerduty-alert.png)

## Enforce Security Compliance

In the preceding sections, we ventured through:

- The nuances of a security baseline and its formulation
- Evaluating cloud resources in light of this baseline
- The process of notifications in the event of security baseline violations

Now, our mission is to weave these threads together into a seamless, automated process. Our goal is to ensure every cloud resource—whether created, updated, or deleted—aligns with our security baseline. To accomplish this, we establish a job that triggers the report command in response to a resource-changed event. This job, upon detecting any issues, will dispatch a message to a designated chat application or generate an alert via PagerDuty or AlertManager.

![Create Job](./img/create-job.jpg)

Resoto ceaselessly scans your infrastructure, covering all integrated cloud providers, accounts, and regions. After collecting the most recent data, Resoto propels the job we have set up. The report command measures the current state of your infrastructure against the pre-established security baseline. Should it stumble upon a security violation, it swiftly communicates this through the chosen alert system - a chat application or an alert in PagerDuty or AlertManager.

By automating the security baseline assessment and the consequential alert generation, we've turned the tedious and complex aspects of cloud security into a straightforward process. This immediate alert system ensures rapid detection of security issues following any changes in the infrastructure.

Our attention can now pivot to the crux of the matter - remediation. With every detected issue, Resoto not only highlights the affected cloud resource within the user interface but also furnishes guidance on resolution paths.
