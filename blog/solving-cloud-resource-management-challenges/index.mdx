# Solving Cloud Resource Management Challenges

Software engineers working with <abbr title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</abbr> have every cloud service imaginable at their fingertips, and developer velocity could hardly be higher. But, even the most shiny of coins has two sides.

While developers can freely spin up compute instances and databases in addition to less tangible things like Lambda functions or virtual identitiesâ€”at some point, someone will ask, "What is all of this?"

And as that person hacks away in the CLI trying to get an overview of resources spanning multiple <abbr title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</abbr> accounts, they will inevitably get frustrated.

**While Amazon has been a pioneer in cloud computing and offers the largest array of services, there are some things that just aren't so ideal. Namely, API consistency.**

In this post, I describe a few of the challenges and quirks with the <abbr title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</abbr> API and why we're building Resoto. _(Spoiler alert: It is so that you don't have to!)_

**If you're curious about the implementation of new resources or new services, please take a look at [Contributing to the AWS Collector](/docs/development/plugins/aws).**

PRs are always welcomeâ€”Resoto is an open-source product, after all! While there is a recipe to follow for each <abbr title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</abbr> service, there are many pitfalls and the devil is in the details. Keep reading below for a few examplesâ€¦

:::

## Retrieving Cloud Resource Information

Generally speaking, the API for every service covers the typical resource lifecycle: creation, tagging, description, and deletion. However, this is where the similarities end. In Resoto, [everything is a resource](../multi-cloud-resource-management/index.mdx).

Therefore, we will be on the lookout for any calls in the realm of `list-...`, `get-...-attributes`, or `describe-...`. This is where the divergence begins.

Can you get complete metadata for all resources of the same kind in a single call, or do you have to make nested calls for every item? For <abbr title="Elastic Compute Cloud">EC2</abbr>, we are lucky and get everything in one go. Other services, however, force you to first retrieve a list of resource identifiers (more on that [below](./index.mdx#cloud-resource-identification)) and _then_ query for the attributes or descriptions of each result.

Obtaining metadata by means of manual exploration is extremely difficult. **Programmatically, however, it is not half as bad because Resoto gathers the complete metadata for each and every resource in each collect run.**

## Cloud Resource Identification

In an ideal world, every question concerning the distinct identification of any resource should be answered by its ARN. (That's the whole idea behind ARNs!) However, the reality is not so simple.

Let's say you wish to tag a `RestApi` in `ApiGateway`. Looking at the CLI documentation, you can find a [`tag-resource` command](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/apigateway/tag-resource.html) and provide the <abbr title="Amazon Resource Name">ARN</abbr> of the resource and the tags you wish to add.

But what is the <abbr title="Amazon Resource Name">ARN</abbr> of the `RestApi`? If you thought that this rather crucial bit of information would be returned by a [`get-rest-apis` call](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/apigateway/get-rest-apis.html), [you're mistaken](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/apigateway/get-rest-apis.html#output).

You need to either assemble the <abbr title="Amazon Resource Name">ARN</abbr> manually or try to find it somewhere in the management console.

### ARNs in Resoto

**This is why we have taken great care to provide ARNs for every resource in Resoto.** You no longer have to care about these idiosyncrasies!

Aside from ARNs, resources can have a name and/or ID. (Sometimes they're the same, though!) The [output of `describe-volumes`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/ec2/describe-volumes.html#output) contains a string `KmsKeyId`â€”surely this contains the ID of a <abbr title="Key Management Service">KMS</abbr> key?

_Wrong!_ Many references to <abbr title="Key Management Service">KMS</abbr> keys are named `Id` but actually contain the ARN. While this _is_ noted in the documentation, it can still be a source of confusion. It's not uncommon to reference resources by ID within and across <abbr title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</abbr> services, so this behaviour is unexpected to say the least.

## Cloud Resource Data Type Inconsistencies

Let's step back into retrieving metadata for resources. The information varies in complexity and volume. Some properties do have reasonable data types. The [size (in bytes) of a Glacier Vault](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/glacier/describe-vault.html#output) is a long integer. Whether a [Glacier Job has completed](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/glacier/describe-job.html#output) is a boolean. Let this not lull you in a false sense of comfort, though.

Would you like to know how many [subscriptions of an SNS topic](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/sns/get-topic-attributes.html#output) have been confirmed? Be sure to convert this string to an integer if you perform any arithmetic operations or comparisons! Do you need to know whether or not the confirmation for a subscription is still pending? This binary piece of information is a string, too!

There are even more inconsistencies to be found in representations of date and time data. Are you interested in the age of an <abbr title="Elastic Compute Cloud">EC2</abbr> instance or a Lambda function? You get an ISO-format datetime string. But if you want to know when an <abbr title="Simple Queue Service">SQS</abbr> queue was created? You instead have to make do with a timestamp in epoch time.

While it is certainly possible to work with this data, you need specific, contextual knowledge to do soâ€¦ _unless you're using Resoto_. [**Resoto provides consistent data types across all resources.**](/docs/reference/unified-data-model)

## Cloud Resource Tagging

If done diligently, [resource tagging](/docs/concepts/resource-management/tagging) strategies can make a real difference to infrastructure sprawl. Tagging [<abbr title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</abbr> resources](/docs/reference/unified-data-model/aws) can follow a plethora of patterns though.

`tag-resource`, `tag-queue`, `add-tags-to-resource`, `create-or-update-tags`, `update-tags-for-resource`, etc.â€¦ the options are almost as numerous as the services. Do you have to provide the tags as an array or as a hashmap? Can you do multiple tags at once or is it one-by-one only?

### Applying Cloud Resource Tagging Strategies with Resoto

The workload of tagging existing resources can blow out of proportion really quickly because all the services do their own thing.

At this point I'm sure you're guessing it already: **you don't have to worry about any of this when you use Resoto to apply tags.**

Below is a comparison of how to add an `owner: jenkins` tag to an [<abbr title="Elastic Compute Cloud">EC2</abbr> instance](/docs/reference/unified-data-model/aws#aws_ec2_instance) or [<abbr title="Simple Queue Service">SQS</abbr> queue](/docs/reference/unified-data-model/aws#aws_sqs_queue) in the <abbr title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</abbr> CLI versus in [Resoto's CLI](/docs/reference/cli):

:::tip[EC2 Instance]

```bash title="Tagging in the AWS CLI ðŸ˜’"
> aws ec2 create-tags â€“resources jenkins-master â€“tags Key=owner,Value=jenkins
```

```bash title="Tagging in Resoto ðŸ’œ"
> search is(aws_ec2_instance) and name = jenkins-master | tag update owner jenkins
```

:::

:::tip[SQS Queue]

```bash title="Tagging in the AWS CLI ðŸ˜’"
> aws sqs tag-queue â€“queue-url https://sqs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/123456789012/MyQueue â€“tags owner=jenkins
```

```bash title="Tagging in Resoto ðŸ’œ"
> search is(aws_sqs_queue) and sqs_queue_url = https://sqs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/123456789012/MyQueue | tag update owner jenkins
```

## <abbr title="too long; didn't read">TL;DR</abbr>

All of these examples are taken from our experiences implementing Resoto's [<abbr title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</abbr> collector](/docs/how-to-guides/data-sources/collect-aws-resource-data). Wading through the <abbr title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</abbr> CLI documentation and attempting to obtain the desired data has resulted in reactions ranging from ðŸ¤¨ all the way to ðŸ¤¬.

We dove deep into the details of the responses of each API call and CLI command. But should this be necessary to get meaningful data? Should all of this niche knowledge be required?

At Some Engineering, we think not! **Exploring and maintaining cloud infrastructure should be straightforward and you should be able to focus on solving actual problems.**
