# Resoto vs. AWS Nuke

**Resoto can be used as an alternative to [AWS Nuke](https://github.com/rebuy-de/aws-nuke).**

Unlike its name may suggest, AWS Nuke is _not_ a native AWS service. AWS Nuke is maintained by [Rebuy](https://rebuy.de), an e-commerce company that provides personalized shopping experiences for [Shopify](https://shopify.com) stores.

## Similarities Between Resoto and AWS Nuke {#similarities}

With both Resoto and AWS Nuke, you can:

- Nuke an AWS account
- [Delete resources](/docs/concepts/resource-management/cleanup)
- List resources marked for deletion
- [Protect individual resources and resource groups from deletion](/docs/concepts/resource-management/protection)

Both Resoto and AWS Nuke are open source.

## Differences Between Resoto and AWS Nuke {#differences}

AWS Nuke was built for managing [AWS resources](/docs/how-to-guides/data-sources/collect-aws-resource-data), and addresses a single use case only: deleting AWS resources for cost savings.

Resoto, on the other hand, also supports [Kubernetes](/docs/how-to-guides/data-sources/collect-kubernetes-resource-data) and other cloud providers (including [Google Cloud](/docs/how-to-guides/data-sources/collect-google-cloud-resource-data) and [DigitalOcean](/docs/how-to-guides/data-sources/collect-digitalocean-resource-data)). In addition, Resoto offers capabilities beyond resource cleanup.

|  | Resoto | AWS Nuke |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Discovery** | Discovers resources and visualizes the "blast radius" of deleting a resource. | Does not offer resource discovery or inspection.<br /><br />Can only delete resources listed in the AWS Nuke configuration file. |
| **Cleanup** | Performs dependency-aware resource cleanup, deleting resources in the required order based on [delete dependencies](/docs/reference/search/traversals#delete-edges). | Performs "brute force" deletion of resources without regard for dependencies, which can lead to errors.<br /><br />Leaves behind orphaned resources that may require AWS support to delete. |
| **Data Model** | Uses a [unified data model](/docs/reference/unified-data-model) for all platforms and resources.<br /><br />[Unifying base properties and common abstractions allows you to search, sort, aggregate, and act on a higher level of abstraction and query resources across clouds.](/blog/multi-cloud-resource-management) | Properties (e.g., resource age) are not represented consistently across resources.<br /><br />Only supports filtering by <abbr title="Amazon Resource Names">ARN</abbr>s. |
| **Automation** | Offers [commands](/docs/reference/cli) and [jobs](/docs/concepts/automation#jobs) to automate [resource management](/docs/concepts/resource-management) and/or remediation.<br /><br />Can be used to write custom code and rules for any resource. | Runs a single time. Does not offer scheduling or job functionality.<br /><br />Requires custom scripts to generate configuration files targeting specific resources and/or resource groups.<br /><br />Can timeout when scheduled using AWS services (e.g., AWS Lambda has a maximum execution time of 15 minutes). |
| **Multi-Account** | Cleans up resources in any number of accounts in a single run. | Does not offer multi-account support. |
| **Performance** | Separates [data ingest](/docs/concepts/cloud-data-sync), transformations, [storage](/docs/concepts/asset-inventory-graph), and [queries](/docs/reference/search) for a scalable approach to analyzing infrastructure. | Does not allow for resource analysis independent of delete runs.<br /><br />Requires multiple, time-consuming passes to find resources to delete. |
