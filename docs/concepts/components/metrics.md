# Resoto Metrics

[Resoto Metrics (`resotometrics`)](https://github.com/someengineering/resoto/tree/main/resotometrics) takes [Resoto Core](./core.md) graph data and runs aggregation functions on the data.

The aggregated metrics are then exposed in a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io)-compatible format.
