# Cleanup Expired

This plugin looks for resources with the tags `expiration` or `resoto:expires` and flags them for cleanup if they are expired.

## Tag format

| Tag                 | Format                      | Description                                          |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `resoto:expires`    | `2019-09-05T10:40:11+00:00` | ISO 8601 Timestamp                                   |
| `resoto:expiration` | `24h`                       | A timedelta relative to the resource's creation time |
| `expiration`        | `24h`                       | A timedelta relative to the resource's creation time |

Example of valid units for the `expiration` tag:

```
weeks
days
hours
minutes
```

Each of them can be abbreviated down to one letter. E.g. `7d`, `24h`, `60m`, etc. A space in between the numeric and the unit is optional, meaning `7d` and `7 days` are equivalent.

## Usage

In `resh` execute

```
> config edit resoto.worker
```

and find the following section

```
plugin_cleanup_expired:
  # Enable plugin?
  enabled: false
```
