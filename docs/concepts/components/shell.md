# Resoto Shell

The `resh` command starts Resoto Shell (`resotoshell`), which is used to interact with [`resotocore`](./core.md).

Resoto Shell allows you to explore the graph, find resources of interest, mark them for cleanup, fix their tagging, aggregate over their metadata to create metrics, and format the output for use in a third-party script or system.

Please refer to the [Command-Line Interface (CLI) reference section](../../reference/cli/index.md) for details on how to use Resoto Shell.
