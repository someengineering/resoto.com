# Configure Cloud Provider Access

```mdx-code-block
import { useCurrentSidebarCategory } from '@docusaurus/theme-common';
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
```

Resoto needs to authenticate with the cloud accounts you would like indexed.

Resoto currently has out-of-the-box support for the following cloud providers:

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>

Want to see support for other providers? Let us know on [GitHub](https://github.com/someengineering/resoto) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/someengineering)!
