# Configure Resoto

Resoto needs to be configured to authenticate with your cloud providers so it can access your resources.

## Setup Wizard

When you open Resoto UI for the first time, you will see a [Setup Wizard](../../reference/user-interface/setup-wizard.mdx) that will guide you through the initial setup process. The [Setup Wizard](../../reference/user-interface/setup-wizard.mdx) allows you to configure one or more cloud providers.

:::note

**Resoto requires a [set of required permissions](../../reference/permissions/aws.mdx) to access AWS resources.**

We provide a CloudFormation template that creates a role with the required permissions. You can use this template to roll out the permissions to your entire organization.

See [How to Roll Out Resoto AWS Permissions with CloudFormation](../../how-to-guides/configuration/roll-out-resoto-aws-permissions-with-cloudformation/index.mdx) for step-by-step directions on how to use the template.

**The [Setup Wizard](../../reference/user-interface/setup-wizard.mdx) provides simplified configuration options to aid in the initial setup of a new Resoto install.**

More complex configuration options are available in the [Configuration Editor](../../reference/user-interface/configuration-editor.mdx):

See [Data Sources How-To Guides](../../how-to-guides/data-sources/index.mdx) for detailed step-by-step directions on how to configure cloud providers.
