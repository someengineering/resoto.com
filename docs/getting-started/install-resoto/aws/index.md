# Deploy Resoto to Amazon Web Services

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
```

We offer two ways of deploying Resoto to [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com): using the [Resoto web installer](./web-installer/index.md) or the Resoto [CDK construct](./cdk/index.md).

:::tip

The [Resoto web installer](./web-installer/index.md) is the easiest way to get a production-grade setup, whereas the [CDK construct](./cdk/index.md) is a bit more involved but gives you more control over the setup and does not require you to send us your cloud credentials.
