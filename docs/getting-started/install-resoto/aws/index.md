# Install Resoto on AWS

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
```

We offer two ways of installing Resoto to [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com): using the Resoto [CloudFormation template](./cloudformation.md) or the Resoto [CDK construct](./cdk.md).

:::tip

The [CloudFormation template](./cloudformation.md) is the easiest way to get a production-grade setup, whereas the [CDK construct](./cdk.md) is a bit more involved but gives you more control over the setup.
