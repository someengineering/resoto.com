# Deploy Resoto to Amazon Web Services

We offer two ways of deploying Resoto to [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com): using the [Resoto web installer](./web-installer/index.mdx) or the Resoto [CDK construct](./cdk.mdx).

:::warning Deprecation notice

The Resoto <abbr title="Cloud Development Kit">CDK</abbr> construct is no longer actively maintained. We recommend [running Resoto using Docker](../index.mdx).

:::

:::info

The [Resoto web installer](./web-installer/index.mdx) is the easiest way to get a production-grade setup, whereas the [CDK construct](./cdk.mdx) is a bit more involved but gives you more control over the setup and does not require you to send us your cloud credentials.

:::tip

Don't want to manage your own Resoto installation? Check out **[Fix](https://fix.security)**, an all-in-one security dashboard built on top of Resoto.
