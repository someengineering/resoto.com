# Install Resoto

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
```

Resoto can currently be installed using [Docker](./docker.md), [Kubernetes](./kubernetes.md), or [pip](./pip.md).

:::note

Resoto consists of a number of distributed components that are designed to run 24/7 on a server. Running Resoto on a laptop will not provide a good user experience! The easiest way to get started is using our Helm chart on a Kubernetes cluster.
