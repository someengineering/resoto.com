# Install Resoto

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
```

Resoto can be deployed to [Amazon Web Services](./aws/index.md) and [Kubernetes](./kubernetes.md) or installed locally via [Docker](./local/docker.md), or [pip](./local/pip.md).

:::info

Resoto consists of a number of distributed components that are intended to run 24/7 on a server. Running Resoto on a laptop will not provide a good user experience!
