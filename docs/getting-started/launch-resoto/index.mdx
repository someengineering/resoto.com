1. Resoto provides a service that exposes Resoto UI on port `8900`. We recommend configuring an [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress) with a valid certificate for UI access, but you can port-forward the service as a temporary solution:

   ```bash
   $ kubectl port-forward services/resoto-resotocore 8900
