# Next Steps

**Congratulations! You have successfully installed Resoto and configured access to the cloud providers you would like to index.**

The [How-To Guides](../how-to-guides/index.md) section of our documentation provides step-by-step instructions for performing various tasks within Resoto, such as [search](../how-to-guides/search/index.md), [cleanup](../how-to-guides/cleanup/index.md), [alerting](../how-to-guides/alerting/index.md), and [data export](../how-to-guides/data-export/index.md).

If you would like to learn more about Resoto's inner workings and more advanced use cases, the [Concepts](../concepts/index.md) section describes key topics and ideas, and provides an overview of how Resoto works and its [components](../concepts/components/index.md).
