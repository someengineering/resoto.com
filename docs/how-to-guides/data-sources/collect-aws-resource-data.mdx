# How to Collect AWS Resource Data

The [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](../../reference/unified-data-model/aws.mdx) collector is configured within the [Resoto Worker configuration](../../reference/configuration/index.mdx) via the [`config` command](../../reference/cli/config) in [Resoto Shell](../../reference/components/shell).

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have already [installed](../../getting-started/install-resoto/index.mdx) Resoto.

## Directions

### 1. Enable the AWS Collector

1. Open the [Resoto Worker configuration](../../reference/configuration/index.mdx) via the [`config` command](../../reference/cli/config) in [Resoto Shell](../../reference/components/shell):

   ```bash
   > config edit resoto.worker
   ```

2. Add `aws` to the list of collectors by modifying the configuration as follows:

   ```yaml
   resotoworker:
     ...
     # List of collectors to run
     collector:
   # highlight-next-line
       - 'aws'
       ...
   ...
   ```

### 2. Authenticate with AWS

**Resoto supports the authentication mechanisms described in the [Boto3 SDK documentation](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html).** You can authenticate with [<abbr title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</abbr>](../../reference/unified-data-model/aws.mdx) via an instance profile, an access key, or profiles. These credentials can be defined in the Resoto Worker configuration or as environment variables.

<TabItem value="configuration" label="Resoto Worker Configuration">
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="instance-profile" label="Instance Profile">

1.  Configure an [instance profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html).

2.  Open the [Resoto Worker configuration](../../reference/configuration/index.mdx) via the [`config` command](../../reference/cli/config) in [Resoto Shell](../../reference/components/shell):

    ```bash
    > config edit resoto.worker
    ```

3.  Add the contents of your `credentials` file to the `resotoworker` section of the configuration as follows:

    ```yaml title="Resoto Worker configuration"
    resotoworker:
      ...
    # highlight-start
      write_files_to_home_dir:
        - path: ~/.aws/credentials
          content: |
            [default]
            region = us-west-2

            role_arn = arn:aws:iam::235059640852:role/Resoto
            external_id = a5eMybsyGIowimdZqpZWxxxxxxxxxxxx
            credential_source = Ec2InstanceMetadata
    # highlight-end
    ...
    ```

    :::note

    If you do not wish to save the contents of your `credentials` file to Resoto's database, you can alternatively [mount the `~/.aws` directory to the `resotoworker` container](../../reference/configuration/worker#mounting-configuration-files-to-container-based-installations).

    :::

    :::info

    Since Resoto is running on your local machine, it can access the `credentials` file directly at `~/.aws/credentials`.

    :::

4.  Modify the `aws` section of the configuration as follows, making sure that `aws.access_key_id` and `aws.secret_access_key` are set to `null`:

    ```yaml title="Resoto Worker configuration"
    resotoworker:
      ...
    ...
    aws:
    # highlight-start
      # AWS Access Key ID (null to load from env - recommended)
      access_key_id: null
      # AWS Secret Access Key (null to load from env - recommended)
      secret_access_key: null
    # highlight-end
      ...
    ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="access-key" label="Access Key">

:::note

Access keys in the configuration are visible to anyone with access to your Resoto instance. You can alternatively define the access key via environment variables.

:::

1.  Open the [Resoto Worker configuration](../../reference/configuration/index.mdx) via the [`config` command](../../reference/cli/config) in [Resoto Shell](../../reference/components/shell):

    ```bash
    > config edit resoto.worker
    ```

2.  Modify the `aws` section of the configuration as follows:

    ```yaml title="Resoto Worker configuration"
    resotoworker:
      ...
    ...
    aws:
    # highlight-start
      # AWS Access Key ID (null to load from env - recommended)
      access_key_id: 'AKIAZGZKXXXXXXXXXXXX'
      # AWS Secret Access Key (null to load from env - recommended)
      secret_access_key: 'vO51EW/8ILMGrSBV/Ia9Fov6xZnKxxxxxxxxxxxx'
    # highlight-end
      ...
    ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="profiles" label="Profiles">

1.  Create a file `~/.aws/credentials` with the desired profiles:

    ```ini title="~/.aws/credentials"
    [production]
    aws_xxx = yyy

    [test]
    aws_xxx = yyy

    [dev]
    aws_xxx = yyy

    ...
    ```

2.  Open the [Resoto Worker configuration](../../reference/configuration/index.mdx) via the [`config` command](../../reference/cli/config) in [Resoto Shell](../../reference/components/shell):

    ```bash
    > config edit resoto.worker
    ```

3.  Add the contents of your `credentials` file to the `resotoworker` section of the configuration as follows:

    ```yaml title="Resoto Worker configuration"
    resotoworker:
      ...
    # highlight-start
      write_files_to_home_dir:
        - path: ~/.aws/credentials
          content: |
            [default]
            region = us-west-2

            role_arn = arn:aws:iam::235059640852:role/Resoto
            external_id = a5eMybsyGIowimdZqpZWxxxxxxxxxxxx
            credential_source = Ec2InstanceMetadata
    # highlight-end
    ...
    ```

    :::note

    If you do not wish to save the contents of your `credentials` file to Resoto's database, you can alternatively [mount the `~/.aws` directory to the `resotoworker` container](../../reference/configuration/worker#mounting-configuration-files-to-container-based-installations).

    :::

    :::info

    Since Resoto is running on your local machine, it can access the `credentials` file directly at `~/.aws/credentials`.

    :::

4.  Modify the `aws` section of the configuration as follows, adding one or more profile names from your `~/.aws/credentials` file:

    ```yaml title="Resoto Worker configuration"
    resotoworker:
      ...
    ...
    aws:
      ...
    # highlight-start
      profiles:
        - production
        - test
        - dev
    # highlight-end
    ```

    Profiles can be combined with other <abbr title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</abbr> options, such as `aws.role` and `aws.scrape_org`.

    :::note

    When switching from profiles to another authentication option, be sure to set the value of `aws.profiles` as `null`.

    :::

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="environment" label="Environment Variables">

:::note

**Resoto is meant to run unattended on a server using a service account or instance profile.** Resoto supports the same environment variables that the [<abbr title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</abbr> Command-Line Interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli) does (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`, `AWS_ROLE_ARN`, `AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE`, `AWS_ROLE_SESSION_NAME`, etc.).

**When using temporary credentials, however, they should be written to the `credentials` or `config` file and updated out-of-band instead of using environment variables.** This is because the `resotoworker` process starts once and then runs forever (i.e., updated environment variables are only reflected upon restart).

You can specify a profile using `AWS_PROFILE` and, for local testing, SSO authentication would work as well. However, when Resoto is running unattended in a production environment, SSO credentials that require opening a browser window would not work.

:::

1.  Set the required environment variables (e.g., `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`):

    <Tabs groupId="install-method" querystring>

    <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker" default>

    - Add environment variable definitions to the `resotoworker` service in `docker-compose.yaml`:

      ```yaml title="docker-compose.yaml"
      services:
        ...
        resotoworker:
      # highlight-start
          environment:
            - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAZGZKXXXXXXXXXXXX
            - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=vO51EW/8ILMGrSBV/Ia9Fov6xZnKxxxxxxxxxxxx
      # highlight-end
        ...
      ...
      ```

    - Recreate the `resotoworker` container with the updated service definition:

      ```bash
      $ docker-compose up -d
      ```

      :::note

      [Docker Compose V2 integrated compose functions in to the Docker platform.](https://docs.docker.com/compose/#compose-v2-and-the-new-docker-compose-command)

      In Docker Compose V2, the command is `docker compose` (no hyphen) instead of `docker-compose`.

    <TabItem value="kubernetes" label="Kubernetes">

    - Create a secret:

      ```bash
      $ kubectl -n resoto create secret generic resoto-auth \
        --from-literal=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAZGZKXXXXXXXXXXXX \
        --from-literal=AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=vO51EW/8ILMGrSBV/Ia9Fov6xZnKxxxxxxxxxxxx
      ```

    - Update `resoto-values.yaml` as follows:

      ```yaml title="resoto-values.yaml"
      ...
      resotoworker:
        ...
      # highlight-start
        extraEnv:
          - name: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: resoto-auth
                key: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
          - name: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:

                key: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
      # highlight-end
      ...
      ```

    - Deploy these changes with Helm:

      ```bash
      $ helm upgrade resoto resoto/resoto --set image.tag={{imageTag}} -f resoto-values.yaml
      ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="pip" label="pip">

    - Export the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables:

      ```bash
      $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAZGZKXXXXXXXXXXXX
      $ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=vO51EW/8ILMGrSBV/Ia9Fov6xZnKxxxxxxxxxxxx
      ```

    - Restart the `resotoworker` process.

    </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

2.  Open the [Resoto Worker configuration](../../reference/configuration/index.mdx) via the [`config` command](../../reference/cli/config) in [Resoto Shell](../../reference/components/shell):

    ```bash
    > config edit resoto.worker
    ```

3.  Modify the `aws` section of the configuration as follows, making sure that `aws.access_key_id` and `aws.secret_access_key` are set to `null`:

    ```yaml title="Resoto Worker configuration"
    resotoworker:
      ...
    ...
    aws:
    # highlight-start
      # AWS Access Key ID (null to load from env - recommended)
      access_key_id: null
      # AWS Secret Access Key (null to load from env - recommended)
      secret_access_key: null
    # highlight-end
      ...
    ```

</TabItem>

### 3. Authorize Resoto Access to AWS

See [How to Roll Out Resoto AWS Permissions with CloudFormation](../configuration/roll-out-resoto-aws-permissions-with-cloudformation/index.mdx) for a step-by-step guide on how to roll out Resoto [permissions](../../reference/iam-permissions/aws.mdx) organization-wide.

:::info

If you prefer to deploy the role yourself, the S3 URL of the template to create the `ResotoAccess` role is [https://resotopublic.s3.amazonaws.com/cf/resoto-role.template](https://resotopublic.s3.amazonaws.com/cf/resoto-role.template).

:::

### 4. Trigger Resource Collection

1.  By default, Resoto performs resource collection each hour. To immediately trigger a collect run, use the [`workflow run` command](../../reference/cli/workflow/run.mdx) in [Resoto Shell](../../reference/components/shell):

    ```bash
    > workflow run collect
    ```

2.  Once the collect run completes, you can view a summary of collected [<abbr title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</abbr> resources](../../reference/unified-data-model/index.mdx) using the following search:

    ```bash
    > search is(aws_resource) | count kind
    ```
