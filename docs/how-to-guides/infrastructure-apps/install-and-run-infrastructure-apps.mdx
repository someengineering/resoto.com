# How to Install & Run Infrastructure Apps

Resoto infrastructure apps are low-code applications can be installed to extend Resoto's functionality.

Infrastructure apps can perform simple tasks like [cleaning up untagged resources](../cleanup/clean-up-untagged-resources.mdx), finding abandoned load balancers, or sending notifications to [Slack](../alerting/send-slack-notifications/index.mdx), [Discord](../alerting/send-discord-notifications/index.mdx), or [PagerDuty](../alerting/create-pagerduty-alerts/index.mdx).

:::info How safe are Resoto infrastructure apps?

An infrastructure app can not execute any Resoto commands directly. Instead, it generates Resoto commands which are then executed by Resoto.

An app has read-only access to the Resoto Infrastructure Graph using the `search()` function, meaning that it can only retrieve information about resources that are already known to Resoto.

To modify resources, an app needs to generate a Resoto command that does so.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have already [installed](../../getting-started/install-resoto/index.mdx) Resoto.

## Directions

1.  Search for an app using the [`app search` command](../../reference/cli/app/search.mdx):

    ```bash
    > apps search cleanup
    ```

2.  Use the [`app install` command](../../reference/cli/app/install.mdx) to install the app:

    ```bash
    > apps install cleanup-untagged
    ```

3.  Run the app using the [`app run` command](../../reference/cli/app/run.mdx):

    ```bash
    > apps run cleanup-untagged
    ```

    :::tip

    Add the optional `--dry-run` flag to see what commands the app would perform, without actually executing them.

    :::

    :::info

    By default, Resoto passes the app a configuration that corresponds to the app name.

    For example, when installing an app named `foobar`, Resoto creates a default config named `resoto.apps.foobar`.

    If you would like to run the app with an alternative config, you can specify the config name using the `--config` argument.

    Please refer to [`app run` Command](../../reference/cli/app/run.mdx) for more information.
