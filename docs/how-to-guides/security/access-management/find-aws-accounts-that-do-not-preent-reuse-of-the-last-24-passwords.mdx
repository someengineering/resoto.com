# How to Find AWS Accounts That Do Not Prevent Reuse of the Last 24 Passwords

Password policies are used to enforce password complexity requirements. IAM password policies can be used to ensure password are comprised of different character sets.

It is recommended that password policies prevent reuse of the last 24 passwords.

This security check is part of the [CIS Amazon Web Services Benchmarks](https://cisecurity.org/benchmark/amazon_web_services) and is rated severity **medium**.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have already [installed](../../../getting-started/install-resoto/index.mdx) and configured Resoto to [collect your AWS resources](../../../how-to-guides/data-sources/collect-aws-resource-data.mdx).

## Directions

1. Execute the following [`search` command](../../../reference/cli/search.mdx) in [Resoto Shell](../../../reference/components/shell.mdx) or Resoto UI:

   ```bash
   > search is(aws_account) and password_reuse_prevention<24
   # highlight-start
   ​kind=aws_account, ..., region=resoto-poweruser
   ​kind=aws_account, ..., account=poweruser-team
   # highlight-end
   ```

2. Pipe the `search` command into the [`dump` command](../../../reference/cli/dump.mdx):

   ```bash
   > search is(aws_account) and password_reuse_prevention<24 | dump
   # highlight-start
   ​reported:
   ​  id: /aws/iam/123
   ​  name: some-name
   ​  ctime: '2022-12-05T22:53:14Z'
   ​  kind: aws_account
   ​  age: 2mo28d
   # highlight-end
   ```

   The command output will list the details of all non-compliant [`aws_account` resources](../../../reference/unified-data-model/aws.mdx#aws_account).

## Remediation

Ensure "Number of passwords to remember" is set to 24 or higher.
