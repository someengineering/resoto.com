## [WebSocket] Attach to the working queue

## WebSocket Endpoint

The client needs to send all the required headers for a ws connection and has to handle the websocket protocol.<br/> **Note this can not be tested from within swagger!**

This endpoint is used by worker nodes which can perform work. A worker would use this endpoint to establish a websocket connection and register the tasks that can be performed by the worker. One worker can perform one or more tasks over one connection.

In case the connection is lost, all outstanding tasks are rescheduled to other workers. This means the local tasks queue should be wiped in case of connection loss.

Note: the server tries to spread the number of tasks evenly over the number of workers. This number is derived by the number of outstanding messages in the queue irrelevant which tasks are outstanding.
