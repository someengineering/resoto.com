# `clean` Command

The `clean` command marks resources for cleaning by setting `desired.clean=true` to the resources. Resources marked as such will be removed during the [`cleanup` phase](../../../reference/workflows/index.mdx#cleanup) of the next [`collect_and_cleanup` workflow](../../../reference/workflows/index.mdx#collect_and_cleanup-workflow) run.

The `clean` command expects query results (objects) or an array of object IDs to be piped as input. Optionally, you can provide a reason for marking the matched resources to be pruned during the next cleanup run. The reason is logged and can be useful in reviewing why a particular resource was deleted.

:::info

It is also possible to mark resources as protected using the [`protect` command](./protect.mdx). Protected resources will never be cleaned up.

## Usage

clean <reason>
