# `clean`

The `clean` command marks resources for cleaning by adding `desired.clean = true` to the resources.

The `clean` command expects query results (objects) or an array of object IDs to be piped as input.

Optionally, you can provide a reason for marking the matched resources to be pruned during the next cleanup run. The reason is logged and can be useful in reviewing why a particular resource was deleted.

## Usage

```bash
clean <reason>
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description                      | Required? | Default Value |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | --------- | ------------- |
| `reason`  | Reason for marking to be cleaned | ❌        | N/A           |
