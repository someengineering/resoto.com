# `certificate` Command

The `certificate` command is used to create a new TLS certificate and key pair based on the internal root CA certificate. This can be used to create a self-signed certificate for additional components that communicate with Resoto.

## Usage

```bash
certificate create --common-name <name> [--dns-names <dns_names>] [--ip-addresses <ip_addresses>] [--days-valid <days>]
```

### Options
