### Config section format

The config section consists of four sub-sections. `default`, `tags`, `classes` and `accounts`. The `default` section specifies the default `age` a resource must have before we enforce mandatory tags on it. For instance if `age` is set to `2h` this means that whatever mechanism creates a resource has two hours to add those mandatory tags.

The `tags` section is a list of tag names that MUST exist on every resource class specified in `classes`. The `classes` section is a list of resource class names for which tags specified in the `tags` list must exist.

The `accounts` section contains a dictionary with cloud IDs as keys (e.g. `aws`) and account IDs for which tags will be enforced as values (e.g. `068564737731`). Those in turn contain a `name` and optionally an `age` override.

The following age units are valid:

```
weeks
days
hours
minutes
```

Each of them can be abbreviated down to one letter. E.g. `7d`, `24h`, `60m`, etc. A space in between the numeric and the unit is optional, meaning `7d` and `7 days` are equivalent.
