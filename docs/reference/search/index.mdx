# Search

Resoto comes with a powerful search engine.

It allows you to perform a [full-text search](./full-text.mdx) to find resources without having to know the exact name of the property. You can filter results using powerful [filter criterias](./filters.mdx) and traverse the graph using [graph traversals](./traversals.mdx). Make sure to read how to [sort and limit](./sort-and-limit.mdx) the results.

The result of a search can be [aggregated](./aggregation.mdx), so valuable insights can be created from the underlying resource data.

Resoto allows for [merging nodes](./merging-nodes.mdx), which can be a useful in case the information is not part of the node itself but in a reachable node nearby. It also allows filtering results with a certain graph structure using the [with clause](./with-clause.mdx).

## Searching Snapshots

You can search a specific [Resoto Rewind](/rewind) graph snapshot by prefixing a `search` with the `graph=<graph-name>` filter:

```bash
> graph=snapshot-resoto-hourly-20230618T210000Z search is(instance) | count
# highlight-start
total matched: 12
total unmatched: 0
# highlight-end
```

Alternatively, you can provide the `--at` flag to the [`search` command](../cli/search-commands/search.mdx) to search at a specific point in time. Resoto will find the infrastructure graph snapshot that is closest to the specified time.

The `--at` flag takes either a timestamp or a relative time:

```bash
> search is(instance) --at 2023-06-18T21:00:00Z | count
# highlight-start
total matched: 12
total unmatched: 0
# highlight-end
```

```bash
> search is(instance) --at 1w | count
# highlight-start
total matched: 12
total unmatched: 0
# highlight-end
```
