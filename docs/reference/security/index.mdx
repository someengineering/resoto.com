# Security

Resoto is an asset management system that has access to your cloud infrastructure. Therefore, it is important to protect access to allowed users and secure the communication between components. Security is taken seriously and Resoto provides a number of features to secure your installation. All security measures are turned on by default for all installers that we provide.

## Login based access {#login-based-access}

Resoto provides web-based and terminal-based user interfaces that allow you to manage your assets. These user interfaces are protected by a login screen that requires a username and password. Only authorized users can access a Resoto installation.

The authorization uses [JSON Web Token](#json-web-token) and is session based. An administrator can configure the session duration in [Resoto Core](../components/core.mdx), which defaults to one hour. Active Resoto user interfaces will renew sessions in the background before the session expires.

An active user session lasts for the configured session duration and can not be revoked. When the session duration expires, a new login of the user can be forced by changing the password of the related user. An administrator can block another user from the system by deleting the corresponding user data. See [`user` command](../cli/setup-commands/user/index.md) for managing Resoto users.

### Setting up user management

A fresh installation of Resoto does not have a registered user. In this special situation, no login is required but a signup form is shown. The first user that signs up is automatically granted administrator privileges.

Any subsequent user will see the login form. The first user can add new users and grant privileges using the [`user` command](../cli/setup-commands/user/index.md).

## Communication between components

By default, all [Resoto components](../components/index.mdx) communicate with each other via HTTPS using Transport Layer Security (TLS).

The trust between components is established using a Pre-Shared-Key (PSK) that is used to derive a key which in turn is used to sign JWT tokens.

[Resoto Core](../components/core.mdx) is running a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) including a Certificate Authority (CA). Upon start, all components will request a certificate from the CA.

### Pre-Shared Key (PSK) {#pre-shared-key}

Every component takes a `--psk` flag (which can alternatively be supplied using the environment variables `RESOTOCORE_PSK`, `RESOTOWORKER_PSK`, `RESOTOMETRICS_PSK` and `RESOTOSHELL_PSK`). The value of the flag is a pre-shared key—a common passphrase that all components know about.

From this passphrase, a 256 bit key is derived using PKCS#5 password-based key derivation function 2 with HMAC as its pseudo-random function (PBKDF2-HMAC) and a random salt. This derived key is then used to sign JWT tokens.

### JSON Web Token (JWT) {#json-web-token}

If `--psk` was specified, every request that a component makes to [Resoto Core](../components/core.mdx) must provide a valid `Authentication` header with a JWT signed using the PSK.

This is true for encrypted HTTPS and unencrypted HTTP requests, meaning that if TLS is turned off (`--no-tls`) but a PSK was specified, the request will still be authenticated (just not encrypted!).

### Certificate Authority (CA) {#certificate-authority}

By default, the Resoto built-in CA will be used.

Alternatively, a custom CA cert and key can be provided to [Resoto Core](../components/core.mdx) using the `--ca-cert` and `--ca-cert-key` flags.

Or, if you are already running a CA or have externally signed certificates (e.g., [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org)) they can be used using the `--ca-cert`, `--cert` and `--cert-key` flags for all components. If the key is protected by a passphrase, `--cert-key-pass` can also be specified.

The following sections explain the steps Resoto automatically performs when using the built-in CA:

### Establishing Trust

[Resoto Core](../components/core.mdx) has two API endpoints, [`/ca/cert`](../api/retrieve-the-certificate-authorities-public-certificate.api.mdx) and [`/ca/sign`](../api/sign-a-certificate-request.api.mdx).

The former serves the core's public CA root certificate. Upon startup, all other components will request this root certificate from [Resoto Core](../components/core.mdx) without validating the TLS connection.

However, [Resoto Core](../components/core.mdx) encodes the certificate's SHA256 fingerprint into a JWT which is signed with the previously mentioned PSK. When the component downloads the thus far untrusted root certificate it compares its fingerprint with the one the core has encoded into the JWT. If the fingerprints match the CA's root certificate is stored as a valid root certificate and from then on trusted. The trust is established.

Any HTTPS requests between components and [Resoto Core](../components/core.mdx) from this point forward are validated against the CA root certificate.

### Component Certificates

Once the trust is established, each component will request a certificate from the CA.

To do so, each component creates a private RSA key in memory and a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) using that key. The CSR is then sent to [`/ca/sign`](../api/sign-a-certificate-request.api.mdx), which returns a signed certificate. Like any other request, this one includes a JWT signed with the PSK. This way, the CA knows it can trust the requesting component before returning a signed certificate.

Components will automatically renew their certificates a day before they expire.

### Custom Certificates

[Resoto Shell (`resh`)](../components/shell.mdx) can be used to create custom certificates. This is useful for securing the connection to other components like [ArangoDB](https://arangodb.com) or [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io).

To create a certificate, open [Resoto Shell](../components/shell.mdx) and execute:

```bash
> certificate create --common-name arangodb.local --dns-names arangodb.local localhost --ip-addresses 127.0.0.1
# highlight-start
​Received a file arangodb.key, which is stored to ./arangodb.key.
​Received a file arangodb.crt, which is stored to ./arangodb.crt.
# highlight-end
```

See [`certificate` Command](../cli/setup-commands/certificate.mdx) for details.

### Securing ArangoDB

1. Create a certificate as described above and combine the two resulting files into a single PEM file:

   ```bash
   $ cat arangodb.crt arangodb.key > arangodb.pem
   $ chmod 600 arangodb.pem
   ```

2. Copy the certificate to a directory of choice and start ArangoDB using the following flags:

   ```bash
   --server.endpoint ssl://localhost:8530 --ssl.keyfile /path/to/arangodb.pem
   ```

3. Adjust `resotocore` startup flags to use HTTPS and the new port:

   ```bash
   --graphdb-server https://localhost:8530
   ```

## Advanced

For advanced users who would like to communicate with [Resoto APIs](../api/index.mdx), here are some pointers of how to integrate with [Resoto Core](../components/core.mdx) using the same transport encryption and authentication [Resoto's components](../components/index.mdx) use when communicating with each other.

### Retrieving and Validating the CA Certificate

The Resoto CA certificate can be retrieved at <https://localhost:8900/ca/cert> (replace `localhost` with the hostname or IP where [Resoto Core](../components/core.mdx) is running).

In a Python 3 REPL with `resotolib` installed, execute the following:

```python
>>> from resotolib.core.ca import get_ca_cert
>>> from resotolib.x509 import write_cert_to_file
>>> ca_cert = get_ca_cert(resotocore_uri="https://localhost:8900", psk="changeme")
>>> write_cert_to_file(cert=ca_cert, cert_path="./resoto_ca.crt")
```

Alternatively, the CA cert can be retrieved without verifying it.

```bash
$ curl -k https://localhost:8900/ca/cert > resoto_ca.crt
```

### Generating a JSON Web Token

The following will return http headers that contain a valid JWT for the provided PSK:

```python
>>> from resotolib.jwt import encode_jwt_to_headers
>>> encode_jwt_to_headers(http_headers={}, payload={}, psk="changeme", expire_in=3600)
# highlight-next-line
​{'Authorization': 'Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInNhbHQiOiJuSVEzU3M5TGVNS1JHYUNQUEJxMnlBPT0ifQ.eyJleHAiOjE2NDkzNzI1MTR9.KXAmijfSsV-taO3890qJNzXKXng1u38eU6PTrDYTgVs'}
```

### Executing Resoto CLI Commands with `curl`

Use the retrieved CA cert and generated http headers with `curl` in a shell to talk to the Resoto API:

```bash
$ auth_header="Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInNhbHQiOiJuSVEzU3M5TGVNS1JHYUNQUEJxMnlBPT0ifQ.eyJleHAiOjE2NDkzNzI1MTR9.KXAmijfSsV-taO3890qJNzXKXng1u38eU6PTrDYTgVs"
$ resoto_command="search is(resource) | count"
$ curl --cacert resoto_ca.crt -H "$auth_header" -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -H "Accept: application/json" -X POST -d "$resoto_command" https://localhost:8900/cli/execute
```

## Turning off security measures

Security is taken seriously in Resoto and all security measures are turned on by default. If you have a good reason to turn them off, Resoto provides a way to do so.

### Turning off Authentication/Authorization

The authentication/authorization infrastructure is based on the PSK provided to [Resoto Core](../components/core.mdx) on startup. If no PSK is provided, the authentication/authorization infrastructure is turned off. No login is required to access the [Resoto APIs](../api/index.mdx) and all requests are authorized.

### Turning off TLS

[Resoto Core](../components/core.mdx) can be started without TLS by providing the `--no-tls` flag. Please note that this change also needs to be reflected in the startup parameters of all other components, since the url of the core has changed.
