# Widgets

## Overview

A Dashboard Widget can be imagined best as a small application to display Resoto data in a visual representation. A Widget is placed inside a Dashboard and gets its content from a [Data Source](../data-sources/index.mdx) that is attached to the Widget.

Every Widget can only display certain types of data and use only certain types of [Data Sources](../data-sources/index.mdx).

# Adding Widgets to a Dashboard

When the Dashboard is in Edit Mode, you can add a new Widget by clicking the `+ Add Widget` button at the top right.

![Resoto UI Add Widget Popup]In this view, you can configure the new widget. On the left half of the windows, you find all the settings to set which data the Widget will use. You can add one or more [Data Sources](../data-sources/index.mdx) and select their types on the top part, after clicking the `+` button, you need to set up the Data Source below.

On the right side, you get a preview of the widget and find all the visual settings.

# Widget Types

## Indicator

The Indicator Widget displays data as a Number. In the Widgets Options, you can change the background color to change according to the current value.

**Data Sources**

- [Time Series (Historic Data)](../data-sources/index.mdx#time-series)
- [Aggregate Search (Live Data)](../data-sources/index.mdx#aggregate-search)

<div>

- Monthly Volume Cost estimation
  ```
  aggregate(sum(/ancestors.volume_type.reported.ondemand_cost) as volumes_monthly_cost_estimate): is(volume)
  ```
- Total Instance memory across all clouds
  ```
  aggregate(sum(instance_memory  * 1024 * 1024 * 1024) as instances_memory): is(instance)
  ```
- Total Instances across all clouds
  ```
  aggregate(sum(1) as instances_total): is(instance)
  ```
- The Number of volumes that are available and have are older than 2 hours.
  ```
  aggregate(sum(1) as volumes_total): is(volume) and volume_status = available and age > 2h
  ```

  ```
- Accounts per cloud
  ```
  resoto_accounts_total{$dashboard_filters}
  ```

</div>

## Table

The Table Widget is a very flexible way to display [search](../../../../reference/cli/index.mdx) or [aggregation](../../../../reference/cli/aggregate.mdx) results. When using a [Search Data Source](../data-sources/index.mdx#search), a click on a row takes you to [Explore view](../../explore.mdx) to display the clicked resource.

## Heatmap

The Heatmap Widget provides a visual tool to quickly find hotspots of certain metrics in the infrastructure. A good example would be to display the core count or memory of compute instances.
