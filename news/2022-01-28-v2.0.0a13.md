# v2.0.0a13

Starting with this release, Resoto ships with separate Docker images for each of its [components](/docs/concepts/components):

- `somecr.io/someengineering/resotocore`
- `somecr.io/someengineering/resotoworker`
- `somecr.io/someengineering/resotoshell`
- `somecr.io/someengineering/resotometrics`

These images allow for greater flexibility in deploying Resoto, and also make it possible to update individual components independently.

However, `somecr.io/someengineering/resoto` (which packages all dependencies into a single image) is still available.
