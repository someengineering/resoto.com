# Combatting Waste in Cloud Development

[**Jon Edvald**](https://linkedin.com/in/jonedvald) is the founder and CEO of [Garden](https://garden.io), an end-to-end cloud delivery platform that accelerates your development, testing, and <abbr title="continuous integration">CI</abbr>/<abbr title="continuous delivery/deployment">CD</abbr> workflows.

In this conversation, Jon covers how the shift from monolithic applications to microservices has taken us from a single codebase to individual deliverables that are getting smaller and smaller. With the introduction of containers, an application now consists of many discrete components—which continue to get even smaller with the arrival of serverless. And where teams previously had to manage five to ten codebases, they are now dealing with hundreds or even thousands. **Testing and deploying these different codebases has become a graph problem.**

Beyond adopting containers and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), the complexity of that graph of system components pushes the boundaries of existing DevOps tool chains. There is overhead for setup of each component in the graph, which becomes unmanageable with existing tools.

Garden solves this issue by factoring out things that are undifferentiated across different teams, allowing them to focus on their own business problems. Garden builds a directed graph of everything that needs to happen to transition from a bunch of Git repositories to a fully built, deployed, and tested system.

Listen to this episode to learn more about the industrialization of continuous integration (CI), infrastructure as code (with popular tools like [Terraform](https://terraform.io) and [Pulumi](https://pulumi.com)), and how Garden helps developers ship more software faster.
