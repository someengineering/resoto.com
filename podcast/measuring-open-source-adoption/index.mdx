# Measuring Open-Source Adoption

**Historically, the distribution and usage of open-source projects have been challenging to measure.** üìè

Understanding your user base is critical to product planning and development. However, open-source maintainers have resorted to inelegant tactics to gather data on their users‚Äîsuch as scraping [GitHub](https://github.com) user data, performing reverse IP lookups on website traffic, or simply hoping that users submit support requests.

[Scarf](https://scarf.sh) aims to solve this problem with its [Scarf Gateway](https://about.scarf.sh/scarf-gateway) and [Documentation Insights](https://about.scarf.sh/documentation-insights). The Scarf Gateway provides distribution analytics for open-source software and helps maintainers connect with commercial users. Documentation Insights aid in understanding how users interact with project websites and documentation.

In this episode, [Lars](https://github.com/scapecast) chats with [**Avi Press**](https://avi.press), Founder and CEO at Scarf. Avi shares how Scarf grew from a hobby project into a venture-funded startup, as well as his thoughts on the future of open-source business models.
