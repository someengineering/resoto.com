# Episode 15: Why Data Observability Needs Data Criticality

In this episode, we interview [**Kevin Hu**](https://linkedin.com/in/kevinzenghu), co-founder and CEO at [Metaplane](https://metaplane.dev). Metaplane offers data observability for the modern data stack. Kevin calls Metaplane the "Datadog for data," in reference to observability for microservices and cloud-native stacks.

As data volume and tool usage grow, so does the potential for something to breakâ€”resulting in errors and data downtime. In the modern data stack, the chain of SQL-based transformations between the original data source and the computed result is long and complex. For this reason, it's often nearly impossible to pinpoint the source of data errors.

**Metaplane's focus is data criticality, and Metaplane has built instrumentation to understand exactly where errors occur.** When data is mission-critical to the business, data teams become "solution-aware."

We take a walk down memory lane in this episode. We discuss the early days of the cloud warehouse market and the paradigm shift to separate storage and compute that, overnight, turned [Snowflake](https://snowflake.com) into a market leader.

As a result of this shift, the market for analytics expanded and spawned a new generation of data tooling across categories like data integration and ETL, customer data platforms, data catalogs, reverse ETL, and data observability by companies like [RudderStack](https://rudderstack.com), [Airbyte](https://airbyte.com), [Census](https://getcensus.com), [Hightouch](https://hightouch.com), and, of course, Metaplane.
