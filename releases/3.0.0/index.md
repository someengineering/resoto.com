# 3.0.0

```

## Highlights

### UI

Resoto now ships a new UI, which will make interacting with Resoto much easier and a lot more fun.

![New UI](./img/ui-overview.png)

It comes with dashboards to visualize your resource data either from a time series metric, an aggregated search on the current snapshot or the result of a search. You can create your own dashboards and widgets to visualize your data in the way you want.

![Dashboards](./img/ui-dashboards.png)

Explore all your cloud resources in a way you never did before. You can now search for resources and filter them by tags, attributes, and more. It allows you exploring your resource data in multiple ways - for example as a tree view.

![Tree view](./img/ui-explore.png)

Last but not least, it comes with a setup wizard that guides you through the initial configuration of Resoto.

### AWS: All Details and Better Service Coverage

Resoto now supports all details of each supported resource. This means that you can now search resources by any attribute, tag, or any other detail of the resource.

As an example I picked the AWS application load balancer to show the complete structure of the data to expect:

<ZoomPanPinch>

![AWS ALB](./img/aws_alb.svg)

</ZoomPanPinch>

See the full list of supported AWS resources in the [AWS reference](/docs/reference/unified-data-model/aws).

### Cloud2SQL: Export Your Data into a SQL Database

It is now possible to leverage the power of our collectors and export your data into a SQL database. This allows you to use your data in any way you want. You can use it for reporting, analytics, or even machine learning.

We currently support the following list of database servers:

- [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org)
- [MySQL](https://mysql.com)
- [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org)
- [SQLite](https://sqlite.org)

See the the [someengineering/cloud2sql <span class="badge badge--secondary">github.com <IconExternalLink width="10" height="10" /></span>](https://github.com/someengineering/cloud2sql) repository for more details.

### Simplified Installation

#### Kubernetes Helm Chart

Resoto's default installation method is Kubernetes. We now provide a Helm chart to simplify this installation process. You can find the chart in the [someengineering/helm-charts](https://github.com/someengineering/helm-charts/tree/main/someengineering/resoto) repository. Installing Resoto on Kubernetes is now a `helm install` command away. Please see [Install Resoto with Kubernetes](/docs/getting-started/install-resoto/kubernetes) for more details.

#### AWS CDK

If you want to have full control over the CloudFormation stack that is created to install Resoto, you can use the AWS CDK construct that we provide. The construct definition can be found in the [someengineering/resoto-cdk](https://github.com/someengineering/resoto-cdk) repository. You can find more information in [Deploy Resoto with AWS Cloud Development Kit](/docs/getting-started/install-resoto/aws).

### History of Changes

Version 3.0.0 of Resoto does not only offer the current snapshot data and aggregated time series data, it now also keeps track of changes to any of your resources. This not only allows you to see how a resource has changed over time, you can also use it to list the changes that happened in a specific time frame.

Think of an outage in your production cluster, and you want to know what happened in the last 2 hours before this outage. You can now use the history of changes to find out what has changed and how it has changed.

If you think this topic is interesting, you can read more about it in [this blog post](/blog/what-we-can-learn-from-history). Find details and examples in the documentation of the [`history` command](/docs/reference/cli/search-commands/history).

### Extend the List of Commands via Plugins

Resoto has always been extensible via plugins for collect and cleanup. This release adds the option to programmatically add commands to Resoto. We use this feature to provide the `aws` command line tool as part of the AWS collector plugin, which allows you to interact with AWS resources directly from the Resoto CLI.

See the [`aws` Command](/docs/reference/cli/action-commands/aws) documentation for more information.

<!-- TODO: Once the blog post is published, link it here. -->

### Client to Interact with Resoto

We also created a Python client as part of this release that allows you to interact with Resoto from your own applications. You can find the latest version of the client in this [resotoclient-python](https://github.com/someengineering/resotoclient-python) repository.

If your programming language of choice is not Python, you can still use the [Resoto API](/docs/reference/api) directly.
