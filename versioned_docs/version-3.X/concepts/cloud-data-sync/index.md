# Cloud Data Sync

Resoto scrapes your infrastructure at regular intervals to ensure that you always have the latest information about your cloud resources.

## Workflows

Resoto's resource collection and automated jobs are triggered as part of a series of steps called a **workflow**. It is possible to create your own [automations](../automation/index.md) that hook into the events emitted by workflows.

:::info

The [`workflows` command](../../reference/cli/action-commands/workflows/index.md) can be used to inspect and run workflows on demand.

:::

### `collect_and_cleanup` Workflow

**By default, Resoto triggers the `collect_and_cleanup` workflow every hour.**

The `collect_and_cleanup` workflow has four phases: [`collect`](#collect), [`cleanup_plan`](#cleanup_plan), [`cleanup`](#cleanup), and [`generate_metrics`](#generate_metrics). Each phase has a `pre` and `post` event.

![Default Workflow Diagram](./img/workflow-phases.svg)

#### `collect` Phase {#collect}

In the `collect` phase, resources are collected from all configured cloud provider and synchronized with the internal graph.

At the conclusion of this phase, the graph database contains the latest state of all resources.

##### `collect` Events

| Event Name          | Event Description                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pre_collect`       | This event is emitted before collection is started.                                                                                                     |
| `collect`           | Resource collectors listen on this event to begin resource collection.                                                                                  |
| `merge_outer_edges` | This event is emitted after collection is done.                                                                                                         |
| `post_collect`      | This event is emitted after all outer edges have been merged.<br />_Custom logic to react to resource changes should define this event as the trigger._ |

#### `cleanup_plan` Phase {#cleanup_plan}

During the `cleanup_plan` phase, Resoto computes which resources should be cleaned up, and marks them for deletion during the subsequent `cleanup` phase.

:::tip

Resoto ships with built-in cleanup [plugins](../../reference/components/plugins/index.md) that can be enabled in the `resoto.worker` configuration.

:::

##### `cleanup_plan` Events

| Event Name          | Event Description                                                                                        |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pre_cleanup_plan`  | This event is emitted before the cleanup is planned.                                                     |
| `cleanup_plan`      | Cleanup [plugins](../../reference/components/plugins/index.md) bundled with Resoto listen on this event. |
| `post_cleanup_plan` | This event is emitted after the cleanup is planned.                                                      |

#### `cleanup` Phase {#cleanup}

In the `cleanup` phase, all resources marked for cleanup are deleted if [cleanup is enabled](../resource-management/cleanup.md#enabling-cleanup).

Resources are deleted in the order mandated by their dependencies and relationships to other resources.

:::note

Cleanup is disabled by default. Please refer to [Resource Cleanup](../resource-management/cleanup.md) for details.

##### `cleanup` Events

| Event Name     | Event Description                                                                |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pre_cleanup`  | This event is emitted before the cleanup is performed.                           |
| `cleanup`      | Resource collectors listen on this event to delete resources marked for cleanup. |
| `post_cleanup` | This event is emitted after the cleanup is performed.                            |

#### `generate_metrics` Phase {#generate_metrics}

As its name suggests, metrics are generated and provided to the time-series database during the `generate_metrics` phase.

In this phase, Resoto performs several queries to get updated metrics. Since the incoming data will only change during the next collect run, metrics are generated here and cached until the next collection.

:::tip

You can adjust the metrics that should be generated by editing the Resoto Metrics [configuration](../../reference/configuration/index.md).

:::

##### `generate_metrics` Events

| Event Name              | Event Description                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pre_generate_metrics`  | This event is emitted before metrics are generated.    |
| `generate_metrics`      | Metrics generation begins after this event is emitted. |
| `post_generate_metrics` | This event is emitted after metrics are generated.     |
