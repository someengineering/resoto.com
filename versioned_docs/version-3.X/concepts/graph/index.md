# Asset Inventory Graph

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
```

Resoto stores your asset inventory in a graph database consisting of [nodes](./node.md) representing resources and [edges](./edge.md) representing the relationships between resources.

This graph can be accessed to find resources via Resoto's powerful [search](../../reference/search/index.md).
