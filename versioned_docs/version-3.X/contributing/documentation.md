# Contributing Documentation

The Resoto website and documentation are built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io), a static-site generator. The source code lives in the [`someengineering/resoto.com` repository on GitHub](https://github.com/someengineering/resoto.com).

## Authoring Changes

Contributions are made via [pull requests to the GitHub repository](https://github.com/someengineering/resoto.com/pulls). Changes can be authored [via the GitHub web interface](#github-web-interface) (easy) or [in a local repository using your favorite `git` client](#local-git-repository) (recommended).

If your changes modify non-Markdown files, it is strongly recommended to work on a local clone of the repository rather than within the GitHub web interface.

### GitHub Web Interface

On the bottom of all documentation pages, there is an "**Edit this page**" link.

Simply click the link, make your changes, and select the "**Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request.**" option at the bottom of the page.

For supported Markdown features, please refer to the [Docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features).

### Local Git Repository

#### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com) (the below instructions assume you are using the CLI, though [GUI clients](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) will also work!)
- Code editor ([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is recommended)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

#### Cloning the Repository

You will first need to [fork](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the repository.

Then, creating a local [clone](https://docs.github.com/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) of the repository is as simple as:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/resoto.com.git
```

This will create a directory named `resoto.com` in your current working directory.

Next, add a remote pointing to the upstream repository (as opposed to your fork) named `upstream`:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/someengineering/resoto.com.git
```

We will now create a new [branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell) from `main` (it is recommended to give your branch a meaningful, descriptive name):

```bash
git checkout -b <branch_name> main
```

#### Starting the Development Server

We are finally able to get to the fun stuff! ðŸ¥³ Install dependencies and start a local development server:

```bash
yarn
yarn start
```

You will notice that `http://localhost:3000` has been opened in your browser, where you can see your changes reflected live.

#### Testing Your Changes

After you are done authoring your changes, be sure to format them with Prettier and verify they will pass our [lint](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)>) and build [continuous integration](https://docs.github.com/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration) checks:

```bash
yarn format
yarn lint
yarn build
```

#### Pushing Your Changes

When you are ready to submit your changes for review, commit them to your local repository:

```bash
git commit
```

Then, push them to your fork:

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name>
```

You can now [submit your pull request on GitHub](https://github.com/someengineering/resoto.com/pulls)! You are welcome to [open your pull request as a draft](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests) for early feedback and review. Be sure to follow the pull request template!

:::info

Pull request titles should follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) specification.

However, do not worry too much about getting this right, as we will make any necessary adjustments prior to merging your changes.

#### Keeping Your Branch Up-to-Date

If there are new commits to the `main` branch of the repository, you can update your branch by rebasing from your `upstream` remote:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

To update the branch in your fork, you will then need to force push:

```bash
git push -f origin <branch_name>
```
