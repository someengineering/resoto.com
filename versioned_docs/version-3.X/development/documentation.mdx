# Website & Documentation Development

The Resoto website and documentation are built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io), a static-site generator. The source code lives in the [`someengineering/resoto.com` repository on GitHub](https://github.com/someengineering/resoto.com).

**Contributions are made via [pull requests to the GitHub repository](https://github.com/someengineering/resoto.com/pulls).** Changes can be authored [via the GitHub web interface](#github-web-interface) (easy) or [in a local repository using your favorite `git` client](#local-git-repository) (recommended).

:::note

If your changes modify non-Markdown files, it is strongly recommended to work on a local clone of the repository rather than within the GitHub web interface.

:::

## GitHub Web Interface

1. Click the "**Edit this page**" link at the bottom of a documentation page.

2. Make your changes in the GitHub web editor.

   :::tip

   For supported Markdown features, please refer to the [Docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features).

   :::

3. Select the "**Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request.**" option at the bottom of the page.

## Local Git Repository

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com) (the below instructions assume you are using the CLI, though [GUI clients](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) will also work!)
- Code editor ([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is recommended)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

### 1. Clone the Repository

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the repository.

2. Create a local [clone](https://docs.github.com/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) of the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/resoto.com.git
   ```

   This will create a directory named `resoto.com` in your current working directory.

3. Add a remote pointing to the upstream repository (as opposed to your fork) named `upstream`:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/someengineering/resoto.com.git
   ```

4. Create a new [branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell) from `main` (it is recommended to give your branch a meaningful, descriptive name):

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <branch_name> main
   ```

:::tip

If there are new commits to the `main` branch of the repository, you can update your branch by rebasing from your `upstream` remote:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

:::

### 2. Start the Development Server

Now, we are finally able to get to the fun stuff! ðŸ¥³

1. Install dependencies.

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

2. Start a local development server:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

   You will notice that `http://localhost:3000` has been opened in your browser, where you can see your changes reflected live.

   :::note

   **Older docs versions and some [MDX plugins](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/plugins) are disabled in development mode to improve performance.**

   If you would like to test your changes with these enabled, you can run `yarn build` and then `yarn serve` to start a local server with the production build.

   :::

### 3. Test Your Changes

After you are done authoring your changes, you'll want to verify your changes will pass the required checks:

- Optimize SVG images with [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo):

  ```bash
  yarn optimize
  ```

- Format your code with [Prettier](https://prettier.io):

  ```bash
  yarn format
  ```

- Lint your code with [ESLint](https://eslint.org):

  ```bash
  yarn lint
  ```

- Trigger a production build:

  ```bash
  yarn build
  ```

  This will create a `build` directory containing the static website. You can preview the build locally by running `yarn serve`.

  :::tip

  The build may take several minutes to complete. It is possible to perform a faster build with older docs versions and some [MDX plugins](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/plugins) disabled:

  ```bash
  yarn build:fast
  ```

  :::

### 4. Push Your Changes

Ready to submit your changes for review?

1. Commit them to your local repository:

   ```bash
   git commit
   ```

2. Push them to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name>
   ```

   :::note

   To update your fork after a rebase, you may need to [force push](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push#Documentation/git-push.txt--f):

   ```bash
   git push -f origin <branch_name>
   ```

   :::

3. [Submit your pull request on GitHub](https://github.com/someengineering/resoto.com/pulls).

   You are welcome to [open your pull request as a draft](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests) for early feedback and review.

   :::note

   Be sure to follow the pull request template!

   :::

   :::info

   Pull request titles should follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) specification.

   However, do not worry too much about getting this right, as we will make any necessary adjustments prior to merging your changes.
