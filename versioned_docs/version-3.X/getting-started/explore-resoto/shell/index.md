# Resoto Shell

```mdx-code-block
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
```

Another way to use Resoto is the Resoto shell - a command line interface to interact with your resources.

## Resoto Shell Basics

Use the `help` command to get a list of all available commands or use `help <command>` to get help for a specific command.

The Resoto shell has command completion for all commands and all resource kinds, making it much easier to create commands and queries.

There is a lot of analogy to the Unix command line, allowing you to pipe the output of one command into another and create the desired action you want to perform.
