# Deploy Resoto to AWS with the Resoto Web Installer

The Resoto web installer offers one-click deployment of Resoto to <abbr title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</abbr>.

:::warning Deprecation notice

The Resoto web installer is no longer actively maintained. We recommend [running Resoto using Docker](../../index.mdx).

:::

:::info

When deploying Resoto, we only use provided AWS credentials for the deployment. Credentials are not stored or retained after the deployment is complete.

If you are not comfortable sharing your credentials, you can alternatively use the [CDK construct](../cdk.mdx) to deploy Resoto to AWS.
