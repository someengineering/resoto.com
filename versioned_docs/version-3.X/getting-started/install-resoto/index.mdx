# Install Resoto

[Docker](https://docker.com) images allow Resoto to be run in a loosely isolated environment called a [container](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview#containers).

:::tip

Don't want to manage your own Resoto installation? Check out **[Fix](https://fix.tt)**, an all-in-one security dashboard built on top of Resoto.

:::

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started#download-and-install-docker)

- [Docker Compose >= 1.29](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)

- At least 2 CPU cores and 8 GB of RAM

  :::note

  Resoto performs CPU-intensive graph operations. In a production setup, we recommend at least four cores and 16 gigabytes of RAM. See [Configuring Resoto Worker](../../reference/configuration/worker.mdx#multi-core-machines) for more information.

## Directions

1. Fetch the required files from the [`someengineering/resoto` GitHub repository](https://github.com/someengineering/resoto):

   ```bash
   $ mkdir -p resoto/dockerV2
   $ cd resoto
   $ curl -Lo docker-compose.yaml {{dockerComposeUrl}}
   $ curl -Lo dockerV2/prometheus.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/someengineering/resoto/{{repoBranch}}/dockerV2/prometheus.yml
   ```

   :::note

   By default, the `resotoshell` service bind-mounts the `~/resoto-downloads` directory to `/home/resoto/downloads` in the container. This allows you to access files outputted by Resoto Shell on the host.

   If you would like to change the download location from `~/resoto-downloads` to another directory, you can do so by editing the `docker-compose.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   resotoshell:
     ...
     volumes:
   # highlight-next-line
       - ~/resoto-downloads:/home/resoto/downloads
     ...
   ```

   :::

2. Start the services defined in the `docker-compose.yaml` file:

   ```bash
   $ docker-compose pull
   $ docker-compose up -d
   ```

   Upon execution of `docker-compose up -d`, Docker Compose will start all components and set up the system. This process takes approximately 1-3 minutes, depending on your machine and internet connection.

   :::note

   [Docker Compose V2 integrated compose functions in to the Docker platform.](https://docs.docker.com/compose/#compose-v2-and-the-new-docker-compose-command)

   In Docker Compose V2, the command is `docker compose` (no hyphen) instead of `docker-compose`.

   :::info

   Resoto publishes packages for both x86 and ARM architectures for stable releases, but `edge` versions are only available for x86.

   If you have an Apple Silicon or other ARM-based machine, please use the latest stable release (<LatestRelease /> or `latest`).
