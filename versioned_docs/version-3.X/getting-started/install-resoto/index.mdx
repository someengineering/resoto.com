# Install Resoto

[Docker](./docker.mdx) is the recommended method for installing Resoto.

While we have explored various other installation methods, maintaining them all proved to be overly demanding. If you are interested in contributing to or maintaining an alternative installation method for Resoto, please feel free to contact us.
