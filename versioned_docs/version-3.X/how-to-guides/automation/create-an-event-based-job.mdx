# How to Create an Event-Based Job

[Jobs](../../concepts/automation/index.mdx) allow you to define automations in Resoto and can be triggered by the [events](../../reference/events/index.mdx) emitted by the [`collect_and_cleanup` workflow](../../reference/workflows/index.mdx#collect_and_cleanup-workflow).

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have already [installed](../../getting-started/install-resoto/index.mdx) Resoto.

## Directions

1. Define the action you would like to automate. For example, let's say we want to create a PagerDuty alert if a publicly accessible database is detected:

   ```bash
   > search is(database) and db_publicly_accessible==true | pagerduty summary="Databases found that are publicly accessible" dedup_key="dbs_publicly_accessible"
   ```

   :::tip

   See [Search How-To Guides](../search/index.mdx) for guidance on how to write search queries.

   :::

2. Determine the [event trigger](../../concepts/automation/index.mdx#event-trigger) for the job. In this case, since we want to send an alert as soon as a publicly accessible database is detected, we'll use the `post_collect` [event](../../reference/events/index.mdx) to trigger the job.

3. Now that we've defined the action and decided on the trigger, create the job using the [`job add` command](../../reference/cli/job/add.mdx) (replace the value of the `--id` parameter with a unique job identifier):

   ```bash
   > job add --id alert_public_dbs --wait-for-event post_collect 'search is(database) and db_publicly_accessible==true | pagerduty summary="Databases found that are public to the internet" dedup_key="dbs_publicly_accessible"'
   ```
