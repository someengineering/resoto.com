# How to Find Untagged Resources

Resource tags are an essential tool in finding and tracking an organization's cloud resources, but tags are only useful if applied consistently.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have already [installed](../../getting-started/install-resoto/index.mdx) and configured Resoto to [collect your cloud resources](../../getting-started/configure-resoto/index.mdx).

## Directions

Execute the following search in [Resoto Shell](../../reference/components/shell.mdx) to find all instances and volumes that are not tagged with both `owner` and `expiration` within 2 hours of creation:

```bash
> search is(instance,volume) and age > 2h and (tags.owner = null or tags.expiration = null)
```
