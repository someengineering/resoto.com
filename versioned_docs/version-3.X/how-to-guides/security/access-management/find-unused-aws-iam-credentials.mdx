# How to Find Unused AWS IAM Credentials

To increase the security of your AWS account, remove IAM user credentials (that is, passwords and access keys) that are not needed. For example, when users leave your organization or no longer need AWS access.

:::info

This security check is part of the [CIS Amazon Web Services Benchmarks](https://cisecurity.org/benchmark/amazon_web_services) and is rated severity **medium**.

:::

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have already [installed](../../../getting-started/install-resoto/index.mdx) and configured Resoto to [collect your AWS resources](../../../how-to-guides/data-sources/collect-aws-resource-data.mdx).

## Directions

1. Execute the following [`search` command](../../../reference/cli/search-commands/search.mdx) in [Resoto Shell](../../../reference/components/shell.mdx) or Resoto UI:

   ```bash
   > search is(aws_iam_user) and password_last_used<-45d
   # highlight-start
   ​kind=aws_iam_access_key, ..., region=resoto-poweruser
   ​kind=aws_iam_access_key, ..., account=poweruser-team
   # highlight-end
   ```

2. Pipe the `search` command into the [`dump` command](../../../reference/cli/format-commands/dump.mdx):

   ```bash
   > search is(aws_iam_user) and password_last_used<-45d | dump
   # highlight-start
   ​reported:
   ​  id: /aws/iam/123
   ​  name: some-name
   ​  ctime: '2022-12-05T22:53:14Z'
   ​  kind: aws_iam_access_key
   ​  age: 2mo28d
   # highlight-end
   ```

   The command output will list the details of all non-compliant [`aws_iam_access_key` resources](../../../reference/unified-data-model/aws.mdx#aws_iam_access_key).

## Remediation

- From the IAM console: generate credential report.
- Disable not required keys.

:::note

Please refer to the [AWS IAM documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_getting-report.html) for details.
