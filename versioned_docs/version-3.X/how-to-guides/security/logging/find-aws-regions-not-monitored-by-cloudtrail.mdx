# How to Find AWS Regions Not Monitored by CloudTrail

AWS CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for your account and delivers log files to you. The recorded information includes the identity of the API caller, the time of the API call, the source IP address of the API caller, the request parameters, and the response elements returned by the AWS service.

This security check is part of the [CIS Amazon Web Services Benchmarks](https://cisecurity.org/benchmark/amazon_web_services) and is rated severity **high**.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have already [installed](../../../getting-started/install-resoto/index.mdx) and configured Resoto to [collect your AWS resources](../../../how-to-guides/data-sources/collect-aws-resource-data.mdx).

## Directions

1. Execute the following [`search` command](../../../reference/cli/search-commands/search.mdx) in [Resoto Shell](../../../reference/components/shell.mdx) or Resoto UI:

   ```bash
   > search is(aws_region) with(empty, -[0:1]-> is(aws_cloud_trail) and trail_status.is_logging==true)
   # highlight-start
   ​kind=aws_region, ..., region=resoto-poweruser
   ​kind=aws_region, ..., account=poweruser-team
   # highlight-end
   ```

2. Pipe the `search` command into the [`dump` command](../../../reference/cli/format-commands/dump.mdx):

   ```bash
   > search is(aws_region) with(empty, -[0:1]-> is(aws_cloud_trail) and trail_status.is_logging==true) | dump
   # highlight-start
   ​reported:
   ​  id: /aws/cloudtrail/123
   ​  name: some-name
   ​  ctime: '2022-12-05T22:53:14Z'
   ​  kind: aws_region
   ​  age: 2mo28d
   # highlight-end
   ```

   The command output will list the details of all non-compliant [`aws_region` resources](../../../reference/unified-data-model/aws.mdx#aws_region).

## Remediation

= Ensure there is one trail in every region with logging enabled. Consider using multi account / multi region trails for your organization.
