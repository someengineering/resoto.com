# How to Find Public AWS EC2 Instances with Instance Profiles

Exposing an EC2 directly to internet increases the attack surface and therefore the risk of compromise.

:::info

This security check is part of the [CIS Amazon Web Services Benchmarks](https://cisecurity.org/benchmark/amazon_web_services) and is rated severity **medium**.

:::

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have already [installed](../../../getting-started/install-resoto/index.mdx) and configured Resoto to [collect your AWS resources](../../../how-to-guides/data-sources/collect-aws-resource-data.mdx).

## Directions

1. Execute the following [`search` command](../../../reference/cli/search.mdx) in [Resoto Shell](../../../reference/components/shell.mdx) or Resoto UI:

   ```bash
   > search is(aws_ec2_instance) and instance_public_ip_address!=null and instance_iam_instance_profile!=null
   # highlight-start
   ​kind=aws_ec2_instance, ..., region=resoto-poweruser
   ​kind=aws_ec2_instance, ..., account=poweruser-team
   # highlight-end
   ```

2. Pipe the `search` command into the [`dump` command](../../../reference/cli/dump.mdx):

   ```bash
   > search is(aws_ec2_instance) and instance_public_ip_address!=null and instance_iam_instance_profile!=null | dump
   # highlight-start
   ​reported:
   ​  id: /aws/ec2/123
   ​  name: some-name
   ​  ctime: '2022-12-05T22:53:14Z'
   ​  kind: aws_ec2_instance
   ​  age: 2mo28d
   # highlight-end
   ```

   The command output will list the details of all non-compliant [`aws_ec2_instance` resources](../../../reference/unified-data-model/aws.mdx#aws_ec2_instance).

## Remediation

- Do not expose EC2 instances with Instance Profiles directly to the internet.
- Use a firewall or API Gateway.

:::note

Please refer to the [AWS EC2 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html) for details.
