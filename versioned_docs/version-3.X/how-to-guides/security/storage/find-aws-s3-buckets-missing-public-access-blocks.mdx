# How to Find AWS S3 Buckets Missing Public Access Blocks

Public access policies may be applied to sensitive data buckets.

:::info

This security check is part of the [CIS Amazon Web Services Benchmarks](https://cisecurity.org/benchmark/amazon_web_services) and is rated severity **high**.

:::

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have already [installed](../../../getting-started/install-resoto/index.mdx) and configured Resoto to [collect your AWS resources](../../../how-to-guides/data-sources/collect-aws-resource-data.mdx).

## Directions

1. Execute the following [`search` command](../../../reference/cli/search-commands/search.mdx) in [Resoto Shell](../../../reference/components/shell.mdx) or Resoto UI:

   ```bash
   > search is(aws_s3_bucket) {account_setting: <-[0:]- is(aws_account) --> is(aws_s3_account_settings)} (bucket_public_access_block_configuration.block_public_acls==false and account_setting.reported.bucket_public_access_block_configuration.block_public_acls==false) or (bucket_public_access_block_configuration.ignore_public_acls==false and account_setting.reported.bucket_public_access_block_configuration.ignore_public_acls==false) or (bucket_public_access_block_configuration.block_public_policy==false and account_setting.reported.bucket_public_access_block_configuration.block_public_policy==false) or (bucket_public_access_block_configuration.restrict_public_buckets==false and account_setting.reported.bucket_public_access_block_configuration.restrict_public_buckets==false)
   # highlight-start
   ​kind=aws_s3_bucket, ..., region=resoto-poweruser
   ​kind=aws_s3_bucket, ..., account=poweruser-team
   # highlight-end
   ```

2. Pipe the `search` command into the [`dump` command](../../../reference/cli/format-commands/dump.mdx):

   ```bash
   > search is(aws_s3_bucket) {account_setting: <-[0:]- is(aws_account) --> is(aws_s3_account_settings)} (bucket_public_access_block_configuration.block_public_acls==false and account_setting.reported.bucket_public_access_block_configuration.block_public_acls==false) or (bucket_public_access_block_configuration.ignore_public_acls==false and account_setting.reported.bucket_public_access_block_configuration.ignore_public_acls==false) or (bucket_public_access_block_configuration.block_public_policy==false and account_setting.reported.bucket_public_access_block_configuration.block_public_policy==false) or (bucket_public_access_block_configuration.restrict_public_buckets==false and account_setting.reported.bucket_public_access_block_configuration.restrict_public_buckets==false) | dump
   # highlight-start
   ​reported:
   ​  id: /aws/s3/123
   ​  name: some-name
   ​  ctime: '2022-12-05T22:53:14Z'
   ​  kind: aws_s3_bucket
   ​  age: 2mo28d
   # highlight-end
   ```

   The command output will list the details of all non-compliant [`aws_s3_bucket` resources](../../../reference/unified-data-model/aws.mdx#aws_s3_bucket).

## Remediation

Enable Public Access Block at the account level to prevent the exposure of your data stored in S3.

:::note

Please refer to the [AWS S3 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-control-block-public-access.html) for details.
