## WebSocket Endpoint

The client needs to send all the required headers for a ws connection and has to handle the websocket protocol.<br/> **Note this can not be tested from within swagger!**

## Authorization

In case Resoto has a PSK infrastructure in place, the client needs to send a JWT token via the `Authorization` header or via the `resoto_authorization` cookie. It is also possible to omit header or cookie and send an Authorization message as first message on the websocket. Example { "kind": "authorization", "jwt": "Bearer <jwt\>" }
