# Command-Line Interface

## Commands

The [Resoto Shell](../components/shell.mdx) CLI supports various commands that allow you to access the graph database.

:::tip

You can pipe commands using `|` and chain multiple commands using `;`.

### Custom Commands

It is possible to create your own commands by combining existing commands with your own logic. In resoto shell type `config edit resoto.core.commands`. This will open a file and show all available custom commands. Resoto ships with an example command called `discord`, that allows to send the result of a search to [Discord](https://discord.com) as notification.

A custom command has the following properties:

- `name`: The name of the custom command
- `template`: a command template that will be executed when the command is called. A template can have template parameters. See [templates](../templates.mdx) to learn how to define them.
- `info`: a short description of the command. This will be displayed to users when they call `help my-custom-command`
- `parameters`: a list of placeholder parameters. All parameters need to be defined in order to use the command. If the parameter defines a default value, it is considered optional. If there is no default value, the parameter is required and needs to be defined by the user during execution time.

```yaml title="Example custom command"
info: 'Say Hi to the user.'
name: 'hello'
parameters:
  - name: 'person'
    default: 'world'
    description: 'The person to greet.'
template: 'echo Hello {{person}}.'
```

Once a custom command has been defined in the `resoto.core.commands` configuration, the command can be executed in [Resoto Shell](../components/shell.mdx):

```bash title="Usage of the new hello command"
> help hello
# output omitted for brevity
> hello
Hello world.
> hello person="John Doe"
Hello John Doe.
```

:::note

Custom commands are defined globally, so they can be executed by any Resoto user.

## Placeholder Strings

Placeholders are not case sensitive. You can use `@utc@` or `@UTC@` and will get the same result.
