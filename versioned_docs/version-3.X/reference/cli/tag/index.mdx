# `tag` Command

The `tag` command allows for mass creation, update, and deletion of tags.

Tags are a useful to organize your cloud infrastructure and provide additional information to your resources.

[Resoto Core](../../components/core.mdx) puts tagging tasks into a task queue. Tasks are then consumed by a [Resoto Worker](../../components/worker.mdx) instance that knows how to perform tagging for the specific resource and its cloud/account.

| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| [`tag update`](./update.mdx) | Create or update a tag |
| [`tag delete`](./delete.mdx) | Delete a tag           |
