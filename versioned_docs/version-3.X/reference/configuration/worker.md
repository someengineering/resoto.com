# Resoto Worker Configuration

## Writing files to worker's home directory

There are situations where it is desired to write configuration files to the worker's home directory. For example, you might want to store the AWS credentials, GCP service account JSON, or Kubernetes kubeconfig files there.

Resoto Worker allows you to define the file path and file content in the config, and it will write the file on worker startup. Keep in mind that the worker will only allow writing files to its home directory.

:::caution

Resoto Worker will overwrite any existing files.

:::

Example:

```yaml
resotoworker:
  write_files_to_home_dir:
    - path: ~/.aws/config
      content: |
        [default]
        aws_access_key_id=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
        aws_secret_access_key=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
        region = us-east-1
        output=json

        [profile user1]
        region=us-west-1
        output=text

```

## Multi-Core Machines

Resoto resource collection speed depends heavily on the number of CPU cores available to the worker. When collecting hundreds of accounts, [Resoto Worker](../components/worker.md) can easily saturate 64 cores or more.

The amount of RAM required depends on the number of resources in each account. As a rule of thumb, estimate 512 MB of RAM and 0.5 CPU cores per account concurrently collected, with a minimum of 4 cores and 16 GB for a production setup.

The following settings specify how many [Worker](../components/worker.md) threads Resoto starts:

```yaml
resotoworker:
  ...
# highlight-start
  # How many cleanup threads to run in parallel
  cleanup_pool_size: 16
  # Collector thread/process pool size
  pool_size: 5
# highlight-end
aws:
  ...
# highlight-start
  # Account thread/process pool size
  account_pool_size: 32
  # Region thread pool size
  region_pool_size: 20
# highlight-end
gcp:
  ...
# highlight-start
  # GCP project thread/process pool size
  project_pool_size: 32
# highlight-end
...
```

- The `resotoworker.pool_size` setting determines how many collectors (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, DigitalOcean, Kubernetes, etc.) are run concurrently.
- `aws.account_pool_size` and `gcp.project_pool_size` are used to determine how many accounts or projects respectively are collected concurrently.
- Within Amazon Web Services, `aws.region_pool_size` is used to determine how many regions per account are collected concurrently.

:::caution

At peak, Resoto creates concurrent network connections for each region in every account. With a single cloud with 32 accounts and 20 regions per account, for example, there will be a maximum of 32 Ã— 20 = 640 connections.

This is not a problem in a data center or with a <abbr title="small office / home office">SOHO</abbr> router, where hundreds of thousands (or even millions) of new connections per second are supported. However, if you are testing Resoto at home using a consumer-grade router, you should be conservative when configuring thread pool sizes.
