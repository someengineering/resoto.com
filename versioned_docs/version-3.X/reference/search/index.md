# Search

```mdx-code-block

Resoto comes with a powerful search engine.

It allows you to perform a [full-text search](./full-text.md) to find resources without having to know the exact name of the property. You can filter results using powerful [filter criterias](./filters.md) and traverse the graph using [graph traversals](./traversals.md). Make sure to read how to [sort and limit](./sort-and-limit.md) the results.

The result of a search can be [aggregated](./aggregation.md), so valuable insights can be created from the underlying resource data.

Resoto allows for [merging nodes](./merging-nodes.md), which can be a useful in case the information is not part of the node itself but in a reachable node nearby. It also allows filtering results with a certain graph structure using the [with clause](./with-clause.md).
