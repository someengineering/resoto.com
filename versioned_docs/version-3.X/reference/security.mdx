# Security

**By default, all Resoto [components](./components/index.mdx) communicate with each other via HTTPS using Transport Layer Security (TLS).**

The trust between components is established using a [<abbr title="pre-shared key">PSK</abbr>](#pre-shared-key) that is used to derive a key used to sign [<abbr title="JSON web token">JWT</abbr>s](#json-web-token).

[Resoto Core](./components/core.mdx) runs a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) including a Certificate Authority (CA). Upon start, all components will request a certificate from the CA.

## Pre-Shared Key (PSK) \{#pre-shared-key}

Each Resoto [component](./components/index.mdx) accepts a `--psk` flag (which can alternatively be supplied using the environment variables `RESOTOCORE_PSK`, `RESOTOWORKER_PSK`, `RESOTOMETRICS_PSK` and `RESOTOSHELL_PSK`).

The value of the flag is a pre-shared key—a common passphrase that all components know about.

From this passphrase, a 256 bit key is derived using PKCS#5 password-based key derivation function 2 with HMAC as its pseudo-random function (PBKDF2-HMAC) and a random salt. This derived key is then used to sign <abbr title="JSON web token">JWT</abbr>s.

## JSON Web Token (JWT) \{#json-web-token}

If a [<abbr title="pre-shared key">PSK</abbr>](#pre-shared-key) is provided, every request that a component makes to [Resoto Core](./components/core.mdx) must provide a valid `Authentication` header with a <abbr title="JSON web token">JWT</abbr> signed using the <abbr title="pre-shared key">PSK</abbr>.

This is true for encrypted HTTPS and unencrypted HTTP requests, meaning that if TLS is turned off (`--no-tls`) but a <abbr title="pre-shared key">PSK</abbr> was specified, the request will still be authenticated (just not encrypted!).

## Certificate Authority (CA) \{#certificate-authority}

**By default, Resoto's built-in CA will be used.**

Alternatively, a custom CA cert and key can be provided to [Resoto Core](./components/core.mdx) using the `--ca-cert` and `--ca-cert-key` flags.

Or, if you are already running a CA or have externally signed certificates (e.g., [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org)) they can be used using the `--ca-cert`, `--cert` and `--cert-key` flags for all components. If the key is protected by a passphrase, `--cert-key-pass` can also be specified.

The following sections explain the steps Resoto automatically performs when using the built-in CA.

### Establishing Trust

[Resoto Core](./components/core.mdx) has two API endpoints, [`/ca/cert`](./api/retrieve-the-certificate-authorities-public-certificate.api.mdx) and [`/ca/sign`](./api/sign-a-certificate-request.api.mdx).

The former serves the core's public CA root certificate. Upon startup, all other components will request this root certificate from [Resoto Core](./components/core.mdx) without validating the TLS connection.

However, [Resoto Core](./components/core.mdx) encodes the certificate's SHA256 fingerprint into a <abbr title="JSON web token">JWT</abbr> which is signed with the previously mentioned <abbr title="pre-shared key">PSK</abbr>.

When a component downloads untrusted root certificate, it compares its fingerprint with the one the core has encoded into the <abbr title="JSON web token">JWT</abbr>. If the fingerprints match the CA's root certificate is stored as a valid root certificate and from then on trusted.

Any HTTPS requests between components and [Resoto Core](./components/core.mdx) from this point forward are validated against the CA root certificate.

### Component Certificates

Once trust is established, each component requests a certificate from the CA by creating a private RSA key in memory and a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) using that key.

The CSR is then sent to [`/ca/sign`](./api/sign-a-certificate-request.api.mdx), which returns a signed certificate.

Like any other request, this one includes a <abbr title="JSON web token">JWT</abbr> signed with the <abbr title="pre-shared key">PSK</abbr>. This way, the CA knows it can trust the requesting component before returning a signed certificate.

Components will automatically renew certificates one day before their expiration.

### Custom Certificates

[Resoto Shell](./components/shell.mdx) can be used to create custom certificates. This is useful for securing the connection to other components like [ArangoDB](https://arangodb.com) or [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io).

To create a certificate, open [Resoto Shell](./components/shell.mdx) and execute:

```bash
> certificate create --common-name arangodb.local --dns-names arangodb.local localhost --ip-addresses 127.0.0.1
# highlight-start
​Received a file arangodb.key, which is stored to ./arangodb.key.
​Received a file arangodb.crt, which is stored to ./arangodb.crt.
# highlight-end
```

:::info

See [`certificate` Command](./cli/certificate.mdx) for more information.

:::

### Securing ArangoDB

1. [Create a certificate](#custom-certificates) and combine the two outputted files into a single PEM file:

   ```bash
   $ cat arangodb.crt arangodb.key > arangodb.pem
   $ chmod 600 arangodb.pem
   ```

2. Copy the PEM certificate file to your directory of choice and start ArangoDB using the following flags:

   ```bash
   --server.endpoint ssl://localhost:8530 --ssl.keyfile /path/to/arangodb.pem
   ```

3. Set the value of `resotocore`'s `--graphdb-server` startup flag to `https://localhost:8530`.

## Advanced

When interfacing with Resoto's [API endpoints](./api/index.mdx), it is possible to integrate with [Resoto Core](./components/core.mdx) using the same transport encryption and authentication utilized by Resoto's [components](./components/index.mdx).

### Retrieving and Validating the CA Certificate

The Resoto CA certificate can be retrieved at [https://localhost:8900/ca/cert](https://localhost:8900/ca/cert) (replace `localhost` with the hostname or IP where [Resoto Core](./components/core.mdx) is running).

In a Python 3 REPL with `resotolib` installed, execute the following:

```python
>>> from resotolib.core.ca import get_ca_cert
>>> from resotolib.x509 import write_cert_to_file
>>> ca_cert = get_ca_cert(resotocore_uri="https://localhost:8900", psk="changeme")
>>> write_cert_to_file(cert=ca_cert, cert_path="./resoto_ca.crt")
```

Alternatively, the CA cert can be retrieved without verifying it.

```bash
$ curl -k https://localhost:8900/ca/cert > resoto_ca.crt
```

### Generating a JSON Web Token

The following will return http headers that contain a valid <abbr title="JSON web token">JWT</abbr> for the provided <abbr title="pre-shared key">PSK</abbr>:

```python
>>> from resotolib.jwt import encode_jwt_to_headers
>>> encode_jwt_to_headers(http_headers={}, payload={}, psk="changeme", expire_in=3600)
# highlight-next-line
​{'Authorization': 'Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInNhbHQiOiJuSVEzU3M5TGVNS1JHYUNQUEJxMnlBPT0ifQ.eyJleHAiOjE2NDkzNzI1MTR9.KXAmijfSsV-taO3890qJNzXKXng1u38eU6PTrDYTgVs'}
```

### Executing Resoto CLI Commands with `curl`

Use the retrieved CA cert and generated http headers with `curl` in a shell to talk to the Resoto API:

```bash
$ auth_header="Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInNhbHQiOiJuSVEzU3M5TGVNS1JHYUNQUEJxMnlBPT0ifQ.eyJleHAiOjE2NDkzNzI1MTR9.KXAmijfSsV-taO3890qJNzXKXng1u38eU6PTrDYTgVs"
$ resoto_command="search is(resource) | count"
$ curl --cacert resoto_ca.crt -H "$auth_header" -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -H "Accept: application/json" -X POST -d "$resoto_command" https://localhost:8900/cli/execute
```

## Disabling Security Features

Resoto installations are secure by default, but it is possible to disable some of the security features.

:::danger

Disabling security features is not recommended and should only be done in a trusted environment.

:::

### Disabling Authentication

Resoto's authentication infrastructure is based on the <abbr title="pre-shared key">PSK</abbr> provided to [Resoto Core](./components/core.mdx) on startup.

If a <abbr title="pre-shared key">PSK</abbr> is not provided, authentication is not required to access Resoto's [API endpoints](./api/index.mdx).

### Disabling TLS

[Resoto Core](./components/core.mdx) can be started without TLS using the `--no-tls` flag.

:::note

This change also needs to be reflected in the startup parameters of all other components because it affects the Resoto Core URL.
