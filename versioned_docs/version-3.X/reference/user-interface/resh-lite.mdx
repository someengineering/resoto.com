# Resoto Shell Lite

## Overview

The Resoto Shell Lite is a version of the Resoto Shell that is accessible via the Resoto user interface in the browser. It gives you full access to [all the commands](../cli/index.mdx) you would be able to execute in the full Resoto Shell.

Using the button on the **top left of the [main menu bar](./index.mdx#top-menu-bar)**, you can access a **pop-up version** of Resoto Shell Lite at any place in the UI. This is helpful to test commands or search queries while setting up a new Dashboard widget or getting more information about a certain node in Explore view.

## Interface

## Placeholder Strings
